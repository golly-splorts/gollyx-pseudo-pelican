# About the GollyX Pseudo Cup

GollyX is the experimental version of [Golly](https://golly.life).

Golly implements a two-color version of Conway's Game of Life, and GollyX implements
other versions of cellular autonoma rules and colors.

The Pseudo Cup is an implementation of pseudo life, which varies the original rules
of Conway's Game of Life. Conway's Game of Life implements the rule B3/S23 (cells are
born if they have 3 neighbors, and survive if they have 2 or 3 neighbors). Pseudo life
implements the rule B357/S238 (cells are born if they have 3, 5, or 7 neighbors,
and survive if they have 2, 3, or 8 neighbors).

Pseudo life exhibits similar chaotic patterns to Conway's Game of Life, but many
patterns (including gliders) do not exist in pseudo life.
